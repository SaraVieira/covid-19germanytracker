### How to Install
**1. Installing BitBar**

There are two ways to install BitBar on your Mac:
- Use Homebrew: ``brew cask install bitbar``
- Or download .app file directly: [Get the latest version of BitBar](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar/releases). Then copy it to your Applications folder and run it - it will ask you to (create and) select a plugins folder, do so.

**2. Installing Node**
- Install Node by following the [instructions here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Make sure your node exec resides in usr/local/bin/node, else you will have to update the path in the script.

**3. Saving this script**
- Download the [script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thelittlewonder/covid-19indiatracker/master/covid-india.1h.js) on your local machine. Make sure you place this file in the same plugin folder which you created while installing Bitbar.
- Go to the plugin folder and run ``chmod +x covid-india.1h.js``
- Refresh Bitbar.
